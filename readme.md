# Vietnam_war_study
## Intro

The goal of this project is to analyze Vietnam data - specifically looking at deaths.
I've thought about this project for a while and thought a little bit about what it will
encompass and I have to admit that's still a work in progress. The main goal will
be to allow the user to select two different years and see data about deaths during
that time frame. The dataset for this project may be found at this site: https://www.kaggle.com/orangutan/vietnamconfilct.

This project may also focus on bombing runs in Vietnam. I really would like to do
something with this data because I'm almost positive that more bombs were dropped
on Vietnam than on Japan and Germany during WW2. However, this is a possible plan
for further down the line.

# Getting started
### Installing

1. Clone the repo
2. Run [sudo] pip3 install or pip3 install flask
3. Run python3 app.py to run the application
4. Visit localhost:5000 to see the application
5. Please note that these instructions only follow the Python side of this application.


### Technology Stack

1. Flask-0.12
2. Python-3.4
3. Pandas-0.18.1
4. Numpy-1.11.0
5. Vue.JS-2

### Operation

Once the program is downloaded, simply run the program as you would any other python program.
Then follow the address, which your console/terminal tells you to go to see the
website. Again, please do not forget to ensure that you have vue CLI installed
as well as npm.

# Issues / Other

This is not an issue but the way I went about programming this project. The first
four graph are made in such a way that you really should not do - that is each
graph has it's own component. The rest of the graphs are one component with the
data passed to that component through props. This was more a learning experience
for me.
