      <h3>Thoughts on War Deaths</h3>
      <p>
        What stands out for me the most on this graph is how well it matches a
        bell curve. The height of that curve is 1968 which I always knew was
        the height of the Vietnam War. This, of course, was when the U.S. had over
        500,000 military personal within the country. Thus, since there were more
        people in country there was a greater chance for a death to occur.
